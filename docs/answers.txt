1) Branching allows you to work on something and still preserve a working version of the original. 
2) Branching also allows multiple people to work on a project at once and not interfere with each other

f) Status shows the state of the current working tree/directory. Log shows all the past changes to the project.

g) git log Weapon.h

I) Inheritance is the idea of creating new classes that can inherit from a base class that may have similar characteristics. It
allows code reuse and better organization of classes. An example would be a base class for a generic shape and subclasses for circle,
square, triangle, etc. 

II) Polymorphism is the ability for classes to behave differently based on the situation. For example, a pointer to a base class
can be used for all the derived classes, so during runtime the correct class can be pointed to instead of pointing to the base class.
Other examples are virtual functions and function overriding.

III) Encapsulation is using access modifiers (public, private, and protected) to hide details from users; i.e. separating interface
from implementaion
